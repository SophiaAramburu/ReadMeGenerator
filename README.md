# Goal
- my goal for this challenge was to  create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. I was given some starter code and I had to create the rest of the code myself.

## Building a Responsive File

- The first thing I did was to link the files correctly. Secondly, I had to create the prompt type, message, and input. After, I deconstructed everything for the generateMarkdown function and then created what I wanted the READ me to look like/ order of things. Lastly, I created the license functions so that when the user chooses a license answering the license question, their badge will pop up on the top of the ReadMe file once it's generated.
